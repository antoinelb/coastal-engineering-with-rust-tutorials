# Coastal Engineering with Rust Tutorials

This is a series of tutorials to learn coastal engineering and rust made with Claude and based on the [Coastal Dynamics](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/hydraulic-engineering/sections/coastal-engineering/coastal-dynamics-open-textbook) open book from Delft University of Technology.

This comprehensive program combines coastal engineering theory with practical Rust programming, focusing on applications relevant to Canadian waters and MarineLabs' coastal intelligence platform.

## Tutorial Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation
- **Tutorials 3.1-5.1**: Wave mechanics and analysis
- **Focus**: Understanding waves, implementing core algorithms
- **Time**: 8 weeks, 5-10 hours/week

### Phase 2: Applications
- **Tutorials 5.2-10.4**: Coastal processes and protection
- **Focus**: Real-world applications, complex systems
- **Time**: 18 weeks, 5 hours/week

### Important Note on Tutorial Independence

Each tutorial in this series is designed to be **completely independent and self-contained**. This means:
- You can start with any tutorial that interests you
- Each tutorial includes all necessary code and data structures
- No tutorial requires completion of previous tutorials
- You can pick and choose topics based on your learning goals

While the tutorials are numbered to suggest a logical progression through the material, feel free to explore them in any order that suits your needs.

## What You'll Build

Throughout this series, you'll create:
- Real-time wave analysis tools
- Tide prediction engine
- Coastal erosion models
- Port safety assessment system
- Climate vulnerability analyzer

## Learning Approach

Each tutorial follows a consistent structure:
1. **Conceptual introduction** linking to real coastal challenges
2. **Rust implementation** with detailed explanations (self-contained)
3. **Practical exercises** using Canadian coastal data
4. **Environmental context** and social implications
5. **Integration projects** combining multiple concepts

Since tutorials are independent, integration projects are optional and show how to combine concepts from multiple tutorials if you've completed them.

- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/)

### Coastal Engineering
- Textbook: Bosboom & Stive (2023) - Available at textbooks.open.tudelft.nl
- Ocean Networks Canada: data.oceannetworks.ca
- MarineLabs: marinelabs.io

### Community
- Consider joining local Rust meetups
- Engage with coastal engineering forums
- Share your projects and get feedback

## Environmental Mission

This tutorial series emphasizes:
- **Climate resilience**: Building tools for adaptation
- **Sustainable development**: Balancing human needs and ecosystems
- **Indigenous knowledge**: Respecting traditional coastal management
- **Environmental justice**: Ensuring equitable coastal protection

## Example Projects

By the end, you'll be able to build applications like:
- Wave forecasting system for ferry operators
- Erosion monitoring dashboard for municipalities
- Storm surge warning system
- Habitat impact assessment tools

## Tips for Success

1. **Code along**: Don't just read - implement everything
2. **Experiment**: Modify parameters and see what happens
3. **Use real data**: Apply tools to your local coastline
4. **Ask questions**: Challenge assumptions in the models
5. **Think holistically**: Consider environmental and social impacts

## Next Steps

1. Read the course overview (`00_course_overview.md`)
2. Start with Tutorial 3.1 on wave statistics
3. Set up your development environment
4. Join the journey to safer, more resilient coastlines!

Remember: The ocean is trying to destroy everything we put in it. Let's build tools that respect its power while protecting coastal communities.

Happy coding! ðŸŒŠðŸ¦€
